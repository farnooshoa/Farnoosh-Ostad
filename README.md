## About me 👋👩‍💻
I have a deep passion for both biology and data. As an engineer, I love building things and applying my technical skills to solve complex problems. My true passion lies in biology, particularly in genetics, proteins, and everything related to them. I have hands-on experience working in a wet lab, and I've gained extensive knowledge of proteins, RNA, and mRNA genes. My goal is to continue expanding my understanding of these fascinating fields and contribute to advancements in biopharma, biotech, and healthcare.
## What I do 💻
I am a data scientist with extensive knowledge and experience in biological systems, holding a PhD and two Master's degrees in Biomedical Engineering. In addition to my strong background in data science, I have spent nearly two years working in a biotech company.
## List of my projects 📑
#### A work in progress! Is there any end to the learning, though? 🤷‍♀️
### Machine Learning:
* Analyzed different datasets using various machine learning algorithms, including KNN, SVM, classification, and regression, utilizing the scikit-learn library and matplotlib to visualize. Additionally, the algorithms were built from scratch to compare with the built-in ones. [GitHub](https://github.com/MahvashJebeli/ML-algorithms)
* Investigated a large genomics dataset of different cancer line’s gene expressions to predict cancer type. Utilized scikit-learn, pandas, and NumPy libraries in Python. SVM and clustering algorithms (with PCA) were employed. [GitHub](https://github.com/MahvashJebeli/Gene_Expressions_ML_Algorithms)
### Deep Learning:
* Developed a deep learning model using convolutional neural networks and TensorFlow to classify images into different groups and make predictions. The model was trained using cloud computing (Google Colab) and cross-validation technique. [GitHub](https://github.com/MahvashJebeli/Deep_Learning)
### Natural Language Processing:
* Developed a natural language processing model using convolutional neural networks and TensorFlow to make predictions about the sarcasm level of any given sentence. [GitHub](https://github.com/MahvashJebeli/Natural-Language-Processing-NLP-)
